# Python Command-Line Calculator

## Overview

This Python application is a command-line calculator designed to execute fundamental arithmetic operations.  It provides a straightforward interface for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with error handling to ensure robust operation.

## Features

* **Core Arithmetic Functions:** Implements the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides a simple and direct user interaction through the command line.
* **Input Validation:**
    * Verifies that user-provided inputs are numerical values, prompting for re-entry if necessary.
    * Prevents division by zero, halting the operation and displaying an informative error message.
* **Error Handling:** Gracefully manages invalid operator input by rejecting it and terminating the program.
* **Clear Output:** Displays the computed result, or an error message, in a clear and easily understandable format.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x

### Execution

1.  Save the Python script (e.g., `calculator.py`).
2.  Open a terminal or command-line interface.
3.  Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4.  Execute the script using the command: `python calculator.py`

### Instructions

1.  The application will display a welcome message.
2.  The application will prompt you to enter the first number.  Enter a valid numerical value (integer or decimal) and press Enter.
3.  The application will prompt you to enter the second number.  Enter a valid numerical value and press Enter.
4.  The application will prompt you to enter the desired operation.  Enter one of the following operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`, and press Enter.
5.  The application will display the result of the calculation, formatted as: `[number1] [operator] [number2] = [result]`.
6.  In the event of invalid input (non-numerical values or an invalid operator), the application will display an error message and terminate.

## Program Architecture

The application is structured into three primary functions:

* **`calculate(num1, num2, operation)`:**
    * This function encapsulates the arithmetic logic.  It takes two numerical arguments (`num1`, `num2`) and an operator (`operation`).
    * It performs the specified operation.
    * It includes a conditional check to prevent division by zero.
    * It returns the result of the calculation, or `None` if an error occurs.

* **`get_user_input()`:**
    * This function manages user input.
    * It prompts the user to enter two numbers and the desired operation.
    * It employs a `try-except` block to catch `ValueError` exceptions, ensuring that only valid numerical input is accepted.
    * It returns the validated inputs as a tuple: `(num1, num2, operation)`.

* **`main()`:**
    * This function serves as the entry point and orchestrates the program's execution.
    * It calls `get_user_input()` to retrieve user-provided values.
    * It calls `calculate()` to compute the result.
    * It displays the result or an error message, as appropriate.

## Error Handling

The application incorporates the following error handling mechanisms:

* **Non-numerical Input:** The `get_user_input()` function uses a `try-except` block to catch `ValueError` exceptions. If the user enters a non-numerical value, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid number.
* **Division by Zero:** The `calculate()` function checks if the second number is zero when the division operator `/` is used. If it is, the function displays an error message and returns `None` to prevent a runtime error.
* **Invalid Operator:** The `calculate()` function checks for valid operators (+, -, \*, /). If the user enters an invalid operator, the function displays an error message and returns `None`.

## Potential Enhancements

The following enhancements could be considered for future development:

* **Iterative Calculations:** Implement a loop to allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the application.
* **Extended Operations:** Incorporate support for additional mathematical operations, such as exponentiation, modulus, or trigonometric functions.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Develop a GUI using a library like Tkinter to provide a more interactive user experience.
* **Advanced Input Validation:** Implement more sophisticated input validation, including checks for extremely large or small numbers, and localization.
* **Logging:** Integrate a logging mechanism to record all calculations and errors for auditing and debugging purposes.
