# PLP - Power Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of Python projects and exercises created as part of a learning journey on the Power Learn Project. The projects are organized into folders, with each folder focusing on a specific topic or application.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

* **PLP/**
    * **Python/**
        * **1-Calculator/**
            * `calculator.py`: A Python-based command-line calculator application.

## Python/1-Calculator

### Description

The `Python/1-Calculator` folder contains a Python program that implements a basic command-line calculator. This calculator allows users to perform the following arithmetic operations:

* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (\*)
* Division (/)

### Features

* **Core Arithmetic Operations:** Implements the four fundamental arithmetic operations.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides a straightforward text-based interface for user interaction.
* **Input Validation:**
    * Ensures that users enter valid numerical input.
    * Prevents division by zero errors.
* **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles invalid input, providing informative error messages to the user.

### How to Use

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    * Python 3.x installed on your system.
2.  **Execution:**

    * Open a terminal or command-line interface.
    * Navigate to the `PLP/Python/1-Calculator/` directory.
    * Run the script using the command: `python calculator.py`
3.  **Instructions:**

    * The program will prompt you to enter two numbers and the operation you wish to perform.
    * Follow the on-screen instructions to input the required values.
    * The program will then display the result of the calculation or an appropriate error message.

### File Details

* `calculator.py`: The Python source code for the command-line calculator application.

## Contributions

This is a personal learning project, so direct contributions are not expected. However, suggestions for improvement or feedback on the code are welcome.
